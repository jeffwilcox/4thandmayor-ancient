4th & Mayor
===========

4th &amp; Mayor is a Windows Phone application for using foursquare. 

### Legacy implementation
The modern, current implementation of 4th & Mayor is not based on any of this source code (unfortunately). I'm looking for ways to publish the modern implementation in the future with an appropriate license. Thanks.

### Partial implementation only
At this time, the repo contains a subset of the application source.
